# Tiptap UI Components

Tiptap UI Components is a library of modular, MIT-licensed [React components](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/components/overview), [templates](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/templates/simple-editor), and [primitives](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/primitives) that help you build rich text editor UIs faster, on top of the headless [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev) framework.

This repo also includes a [CLI tool](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/getting-started/cli) to scaffold your editor setup or install individual components with zero config.

Use the components as-is, customize them to match your design system, or drop them into an existing Tiptap setup. They're optional, composable, and built for dev speed.


## Getting Started

Start with the [UI Components docs](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/getting-started/overview) to browse demos, setup guides, and usage patterns.

### Installation

Install with the Tiptap CLI to scaffold your setup:

```bash
npx tiptap-cli init
```

Or install a single component:

```bash
npx tiptap-cli add [component-name]
